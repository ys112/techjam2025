## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

1. **Perfectionism**: Don't spend too long on one component
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to the core requirements
3. **Technical Debt**: Keep code simple and maintainable
4. **Poor Time Management**: Use timers and stick to schedule

### Backup Plans:

- **Model Issues**: Fall back to simpler rule-based approach
- **Data Problems**: Use synthetic examples for demonstration
- **Technical Failures**: Have offline demo ready
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize deliverables over perfection

## 💡 Pro Tips for Each Day

### Day 1 Tips:

- Start simple, make it work first
- Save everything frequently
- Document as you go
- Don't optimize prematurely

### Day 2 Tips:

- Focus on clear wins
