- **Scalable Processing**: Handles thousands of reviews efficiently

## 📈 Key Improvements

### 1. **Authentic Data Integration**
```python
# Now loads real data from:
- review_South_Dakota.json.gz (user reviews)
- meta_South_Dakota.json.gz (business metadata)
# With proper joining on gmap_id
```

### 2. **Enhanced Data Exploration**
