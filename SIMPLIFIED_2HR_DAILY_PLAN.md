## Day 2 (Aug 26): Quick Prototype (2 hours)

### Hour 1: Simple Classification Setup

- [ ] **20 min**: Write basic prompts for each violation type
- [ ] **40 min**: Set up Hugging Face pipeline with smaller model (DistilBERT or similar)

### Hour 2: Test Basic Functionality

- [ ] **30 min**: Test classification on your 20 manual examples
- [ ] **30 min**: Basic accuracy check and prompt refinement

**End of Day 2 Goal**: Working classification system, tested on examples

---

## Day 3 (Aug 27): Improve Accuracy (2 hours)

### Hour 1: Prompt Engineering

- [ ] **30 min**: Improve prompts based on Day 2 results
- [ ] **30 min**: Add few-shot examples to prompts

### Hour 2: Feature Engineering

- [ ] **30 min**: Add simple rule-based features (URL detection, caps ratio)
- [ ] **30 min**: Combine LLM predictions with rule-based filters

**End of Day 3 Goal**: Improved accuracy, hybrid approach working

---

## Day 4 (Aug 28): Evaluation & Documentation (2 hours)

### Hour 1: Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] **45 min**: Test on larger sample (200-500 reviews)
- [ ] **15 min**: Calculate precision, recall, F1-score for each violation type

### Hour 2: Start Documentation

- [ ] **30 min**: Create GitHub repository structure
- [ ] **30 min**: Write basic README with project overview

**End of Day 4 Goal**: Performance metrics known, documentation started

---

## Day 5 (Aug 29): Demo Creation (2 hours)

### Hour 1: Interactive Demo

- [ ] **60 min**: Create simple Streamlit app for single review classification

### Hour 2: Demo Polish

- [ ] **30 min**: Add batch processing capability
- [ ] **30 min**: Test demo thoroughly, fix any bugs

**End of Day 5 Goal**: Working interactive demo ready

---

## Day 6 (Aug 30): Final Submission (2 hours)

### Hour 1: Video Creation

- [ ] **45 min**: Record demo video (5-7 minutes)
- [ ] **15 min**: Upload to YouTube, get public link

### Hour 2: Final Submission

- [ ] **30 min**: Complete all documentation
- [ ] **15 min**: Final testing of all components
- [ ] **15 min**: Submit to Devpost

**End of Day 6 Goal**: Complete submission ready!

---

## üéØ Daily Success Checkpoints

### Minimum Viable Progress

- **Day 1**: Can load and explore data
- **Day 2**: Can classify at least one review correctly
- **Day 3**: Shows improvement over Day 2 results
- **Day 4**: Has measurable performance metrics
- **Day 5**: Has working demo interface
- **Day 6**: Has complete submission package

### üö® If Running Behind

- **Skip complex features**: Focus on basic functionality
- **Use simpler models**: DistilBERT instead of Gemini
- **Simplify demo**: Command-line interface instead of web app
- **Prioritize deliverables**: Complete submission over perfect performance

## üí° Daily Tips

### Day 1-2: Get Something Working

- Don't aim for perfection, aim for functionality
- Use the simplest approach that works
- Save frequently, commit to Git

### Day 3-4: Incremental Improvement

- Make one small improvement at a time
- Measure performance after each change
- Document what works and what doesn't

### Day 5-6: Polish and Present

- Focus on user experience
- Make sure everything works reliably
- Practice explaining your approach

## üèÜ Success Strategy

### Core Principles

1. **Consistency**: 2 focused hours is better than 8 distracted hours
2. **Progress over Perfection**: Small daily wins add up
3. **Documentation**: Write down what you learn each day
4. **Testing**: Always test changes immediately

### Competitive Advantage

- **Steady Progress**: While others cram, you build consistently
- **Quality Focus**: More time for polish and refinement
- **Less Stress**: Manageable daily commitment
- **Better Documentation**: Time to explain your approach clearly

Remember: This hackathon is winnable with consistent daily effort. 2 hours of focused work per day for 6 days = 12 total hours, which is enough to build a competitive solution!
