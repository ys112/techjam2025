Another time family came and visit they left came back a couple hours later and was told they was no longer on the ""list"" so they couldnt visit.
One nurse everytime she came in the room she would take the remote amd shut off the t.v and say she didn't shut the t.v off doesnt know how it shut off with remote in hand. Same nurse kept taking my cup of ice and dumping it out, amd fill it with warm water even after saying I only wanted ice.  And everytime went to the bathroom she would stand amd watch me, when the other nurses leave amd wait for the call.
Had problems with receiving seizure medicine and the correct dosage. As well as not receiving all medicine that was to be taken at specific times.

1134,1.0411157380628221e+20,Eric Vander Lee,1601732568970,4,"I am reading a lot of the positive reviews and agree that we had a decent experience with the initial purchase.

**However, regarding quality, buyer beware!!**

Our mattress is now just under two years old and has terrible body impressions and is collapsing outward on the sides. We actually wake up in pain. First I couldn't figure out why my back hurt in the morning, and now I realize it's because I'm sleeping in a giant crater. It was a 900 dollar queen mattress.

The warranty process has been... a nightmare? You have to fill out a bunch of paperwork, take a full on photoshoot of the mattress, foundation, and frame. You have to take measurements with a straight edge and down into the impression. Then you submit the claim and wait. I emailed my claim a month ago, and am finally now hearing back. But I'm being given the run around. One person cant help, so talk to this person. Keep waiting, keep writing more emails... keep sleeping on defective mattress.

I'm not convinced anything good will come of this other than me buying a mattress from somewhere else and learning my lesson.

These mattresses are cheap for a reason! I legitimately think they are the reject mattresses.

I'm sorry I couldn't write a more positive review, but my back hurts from this mattress and I'm over it.

Shop elsewhere and thank me in two years.

I'll update the review if they make right by the warranty.

Update: did honor warranty, it just took several months.",,,0x878eca4cc2055a2d:0x56a77f9788b0c45e,False,Mattress By Appointment,['Mattress store'],4.9,206,43.446950099999995,-96.7059063,Closes soon ⋅ 9PM ⋅ Opens 9AM Sat,257,False,0.95,False,0.92,False,0.65

I figured BHFCU is in more locations and I'd like to try them since I've heard good things. One thing I didn't hear, or I apparently just didn't read myself, is that there is no overdraft protection for awhile. If you apply online, you have a 6 month wait. Well that is unless you sign up for their line of credit or credit card. If you apply in branch it's still a 2 month wait to see if you're even eligible for any protection. During that time, if you happen to send in a check that would overdraft you, they'll charge $22 to the account because you tried to charge more than you had as well as refusing the check, which will cause a returned check fee at the location it was made.

I know, most are just thinking, don't overdraft! Yes, it does make sense but sometimes things happen and the check or debit processes one day before payday by mistake. I've banked with Great Western Bank, Wells Fargo, Highmark, and now BHFCU, and they're the only to have done something like this. It boggles my mind. You have $21, write a check for a doc co-pay of $25, they decline and charge you $22 so your account is now $-1. And then the doc office is going to charge you more. Yeah....

I called Infinity Diesel and explained my situation and what needed to be repaired. Remarkably, they offered me an appointment for that very same day. I was not able to take advantage of the same day offer, but did take an appointment for the following day. I dropped off my truck late that afternoon on my way home from work. They took my information and commented that it would be completed the following day. WOW.....I was certianly impressed.

An hour after I had dropped off my truck, they had it up on the rack getting a real idea of what was in need of repair. They had given me a call to discuss some items that were of concern, and offered the appropriate estimates for my consideration for future repair.

I received a call early afternoon the following day indicating that my truck was finished and ready to be picked up.

I am nothing but impressed with my experience working with Infinity Diesel. I will be returning to complete more of the items they suggested for repair.

If you are in need of vehicle repair, do yourself a favor.....Call Infinity Diesel.

In fact, I remember being clear across town and right next to another similar place.  Only about 2 blocks away.

What did I do?

I passed right by that other store and drove clear across town to this location.

Why?

It isn't because of their service which offers high quality value at every turn.

It isn't because of their communication which is of stellar quality.

It isn't even because they are more affordable, because sometimes such is not the case.

It is because of their exceptional friendliness and smiles.

Makes my day and yours too if you stop by.

Over the past few months every order has been an issue, whether they bring less food than I ordered, bringing hot 2 liters of soda when it feels like 100 degrees outside during the summer, not bringing adequate condiments that were asked for during ordering, and going to chat support has changed. It seems like they are texting a friend from their phone. They literally message you back with sentence fragments that makes little sense and when you ask for clarification it takes a while to get a response. Just a week or so ago I ordered 3 meals for myself and my 2 kids, and they showed up with 2 meals. They offered a certificate to go eat at the facility, which I declined. Tonight it took me nearly 40 minutes to place an order after going to chat support asking how to redeem points because I only got phrases in response to my detailed questions. I’m just really frustrated at how bad service has gotten. I used to tip very well, but I will not be doing so going forward.

You people are a freaking joke. I complain relentlessly and you guys do nothing to fix it. I have even complained to the driver who personally advised her manager and you guys never reached out to me to fix it. You guys will NEVER GET MY BUSINESS AGAIN. I HOPE YOU GO OUT OF BUSINESS. PLEASE IF YOU CAN DO NOT SPEND MONEY WITH THEM. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY. SPEND MONEY WITH A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT CARES ABOUT ITS' CUSTOMERS.

Yet this store requires masks, and they are aggressive in their enforcement of this policy. I travel all over the US- to both blue and red states and this was by far the worst experience I’ve had. I have a medical exemption and cannot wear a mask. The staff gave no refused to acknowledge my exemption and became even more forceful with their over the top demands, which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and HIPPA.
Secondly, they discriminated against us because we were mothers and had teenage children. They refused to let my 13 year old son into the store. Why? - they had no reason.

Dr Abraham was told by this Dr that my peripheral vision was good... it definitely is not.

Honestly I'd be happy if they closed down their businesses, moved, and took their obnoxious dogs with them. I won't be frequenting this business. The negatives of his dogs outweigh the positives of his gas station, auto shop, and other businesses and are a detriment to the quality of life in Aurora, especially in the summer.

I would recommend that they turn closed captioning on so customers can follow along with whatever is of interest to watch. Our server was really sweet and patient. It took a long time for our food to arrive after ordering (40 minutes). There was an error (tomatoes on the BLT were regular, not fried green as listed). However, they promptly provided an alternative main entree of our choice. All of the food was really good. The chislic was tasty and tender. The cheeseburger wrap was delicious.

The apps were good.  The cheese curds were tasty.  The cheeseburger wontons were just OK.  They were rich but a little bland at the same time.  My wife ordered the veggie pizza.  Nothing spectacular by any means; it was OK at best.  I ordered the 'wings' and asked for all drums.  Our server said they can't do that because they're preportioned.

Heads up & not a complaint but there is no seating area to sit if the bar and tables are full. Not even much of a standing area when you have a group. The tables are right there when you walk in.

Once a table became available I took a dirty one and waited for someone to come around to clear it. Even for being a new business it took a little too long in my opinion to have someone notice it needed attention.

We had a mixture of two waitresses which was confusing. One would say they were taking over for the other one but then the other would show up again. It took way too long to get drinks or food.  It looks like someone from the business mentioned they are getting new people hopefully that will help them out.

The salsa and queso taste like Tostinos products. If you want extra chips they won't let you purchase another basket of chips. Instead you have to order the queso, salsa, and chips again. The garlic parm fries had no flavor. Barely any parm on them and they needed salt or something. The burger I ordered was extremely greasy. Someone had ordered the Indian taco and the fry bread was way too sweet. Another ordered a wrap. None of us put a dent in our food as it wasn't good. We paid and left. The one server we had at the end was very apologetic. Two of us ended up with severe stomach issues after eating lunch here.",,"{'time': 1627150848833, 'text': 'Thank you for the comments Jessica.

I can also vouch that their dive trips on the Missouri are excellent, especially if you're a sportsman.  I picked up spearfishing several years ago and its just about as much fun as you can have in the water, short of ocean diving.

Sioux Falls is lucky to have a Dive Shop of this caliber.  Bill Donovan, the owner and lead instructor, has got just about every rank you can get in the recreational SCUBA world.

(OK, lies, I haven't tried the salad yet but with RAMEN as an option, it's hard to choose the salad.)

The broth is amazing and you can tell it have been building flavor for days. The basic of basic ramen takes 6 hours, Justin gives these babies 48 hours to truly develop the intense, amazing flavors. The soy eggs are perfectly soft boiled and marinated beautifully, the fresh ramen is springy as true ramen should be, and the various meats or mushrooms are also flavorful.

The mushroom foil from local Black Hills Mushrooms is amazing and one of our personal favorite sides. The Oxtail Gyoza have a delicious fresh wrapper, amazing oxtail filling, and honestly the most delicious dipping sauce I wish he'd bottle it and I could put it on everything. I even add leftover sauce into my ramen so I don't waste a single drop. The CBR bun is tasty, the bun in spongy as a steamed bun should be and, as someone who isn't a spicy fan, I worried something called WASABI mayo would be too strong but it is mellowed perfectly so you're not crying, ""Wasabi. Help!""

We look forward to seeing the menu expand and seating opening as the pandemic subsides(hopefully, fingers crossed). Brooke is friendly and helpful and I saw a helper to keep those orders flying so I'm optimistic that this place is going to be here not only for awhile but a #1 place to visit to eat in Rapid City.

5785,1.1809128572118622e+20,Amanda Iams,1617329900854,3,"At the risk of sounding pretentious, I feel compelled to wrote a thorough review of my experience with Bokujo Ramen.  I really really wanted to love this and had very high expectations,  especially after reading that the owners were basically food celebrities. That said, I regret to report that I feel they could use some more tweaking to their recipes as most of what I ordered missed the mark. I didn't hate the ordering system online. The space is dark but modern.  I found the staff to be friendly,  although one worker moved incredibly slow. I like to think he was tenderly tending to his tasks but im about 90% certain he was high. The prep area seemed clean and well tended and looks like there is a lot of potential in terms of seating and atmosphere.
Portion sizes were decent. Neither my husband or myself could finish their bowl.  I ordered 4 dishes, which is about half the menu. Only 1 item I would consider reordering and that is the Mushroom Miso. The menu is pretty small and missing some basic things I expect to see in a Ramen House: Shoyu Ramen, more toppings like bamboo, nori, fish cake, togarashi, Bonito and the like, more Japanese or Korean beer options. Again, I realize these things are hard to come by but I know for certain some of these items are available.
Chicken Bacon Wasabi Ranch bun - this didn't do it for me as far Asian fusion goes. The Wasabi wasn't particularly prominent and I felt the chicken was way under seasoned. The bun was nice and fluffy but since the filling was so lackluster it just didn't hit the spot. I'd like to see more variety for buns and more Asian inspired flavors to shine through.
Beef ramen: the color was very promising. I love a milky looking broth, which is from slowly simmering bones for so long the marrow is pulled from the bones and creates a creamy broth that is usually bursting with umami and feels like silk on your tongue. And yet, somehow this didn't have much umami to  it. I found it had very little salt. I'm wondering of they even used a Tare, which is usually what makes or break a good ramen.  In fact, the flavor was so mild I could have sworn it was chicken but it definitely smelled beefy when I opened the broth container. The picture on the website depicts nori served with this dish and mine didn't have any. I suspect the nori would have added a nice level of salt and umami that possibly would have made the dish a bit more palatable. Some furikake or togarashi would have been welcome as well. The beef Chislic was cooked well, but it was seasoned only with garlic powder (I watched them season it). Something soy and ginger or even miso would have been a better choice in my opinion. The soy egg was decent, wasn't super hard boiled and had a softer yolk that oozed a little into the broth, which I enjoy. The noodles were a decent texture and springy as intended.
Gyoza - I love dumplings. I mean I LOVE dumplings of any kind of any cuisine. I love them so much I tried to recreate Mandu dumpling. The wrappers were pretty on par for a gyoza, but the filling was just ok. I feel like it really could have tasted more interesting with garlic chives or shrimp or some other typical gyoza fillings. Pork and cabbage is a popular one that carries a lot of flavor with only a few ingredients. The oxtail was wasted on a gyoza in my opinion. by far the best of the 4 items was the miso ramen.  Miso is typically salty anyways which is the main reason I suspect this Ramen was as good as it was. The broth was flavorful and slightly rich with a hint of sesame oil. The wood ear mushrooms were so delicious and absorbed the broth well. Not overly salty, plenty umami but not overpowering. A great balance of savory that the beef broth totally missed.
All in all, I hope that they are able to develop better flavors and incorporate more items to their menu over time. Rapid City doesn't have a plethora of good restaurants and this one has potential for sure. That said, I don't plan on returning for some time to see if they are able to work out some kinks.",,,0x877d5d1fa01e0c4f:0x8067dd78dcb1c5e7,False,Bokujo Ramen,['Ramen restaurant'],4.8,94,44.0809449,-103.2307259,Closed ⋅ Opens 5PM,751,False,0.9,False,0.9,False,0.9

The store is BEAUTIFUL with so many different items to chose from.
My favorite product is the whipped soap.  I use it as a body wash or just to wash my hands.  It is so soft and smells great!  A little goes a long way too.
My daughter loves the bath bombs. They are fun and smell really great.  Another thing I really like is that the items are not heavily colored. So many times you go into places with bath bombs and soaps and they are SATURATED with color.  Sure they are pretty but there really is no point to it.

It's set up by colors or decor style and seasonal for the most part.

Bonnie and staff make gorgeous floral arrangements and will do custom work for you also per container, flower choices and shape.

Or just tell her or staff the color and let them dazzle you.

I only give 4 stars and not 5 because it can be overwhelming in there also.  But ask any staff or Bonnie for help and you'll be on track.

I'm in love with the cute gnomes now up front and the movable body elves.  Got some for myself and many for gifts this year.

They sprayed sporadically for at least a year but cockroach problem was never resolved while I was living there. Despite my poor credit they were willing to work me and I decided to give them another try at a different location. During the past year at my new location maintenance has visited at least 20 times. The whole apartment has flooded once and on several occasions the water heater leaked into the bedroom and hallway. Most recently water has been leaking from the bathroom ceiling. I've been inconvenienced with running back and forth from the laundromat with soaking wet towels. Maitainace will not notify you when their coming to the apartment and you have to hound them to fix things. They've replaced a pipe and cut two hole in the ceiling. The sheetrock that came down has caused both my bath tub and sink to clog. The bathroom ceiling continues to leak.

The pharmacy staff are awesome. I'm not sure how the place stays open, because it's always empty. None-the-less they have signs recruiting workers.

It's nice to be able to shop at a place that's not crammed full of people like Walmart, and oftentimes check out is fairly quick and simple. However at times they do not have enough clerks and it can be very frustrating to wait in line longer than it took you to pick out your items.

They do have great live plants though. They also have a self watering sprinkler system to keep them looking great and they often have amazing sales. The last thing I bought at Kmart, was a blueberry bush several years old and originally marked at $30 on clearance for $12. Bonnie Plants were also buy 1 get 2 free. In my opinion, Kmart actually has become one of my favoured destination, just for the lack of people.

We have refueled our bike on September 1, 2019 around 17:30. 2.821 gallons at $ 2.67 for a total of $ 7.56 as you can see on one of the pictures of pump # 5. It is also a convenience store that looks good but we did not buy anything. We would like to offer you some pictures.

Pour faire le plein de notre moto.

Nous y avons fait le plein de notre moto en ce 1er septembre 2019 vers 17h30.  2.821 gallons à $2.67 pour un total de $7.56 comme vous pouvez voir sur une des photos de la pompe # 5.  C’est aussi un dépanneur qui a bel apparence mais nous n’y avons rien acheté.  Nous aimerions vous proposer quelques photos.

From the second I pulled up I wanted to turn around. My daughter and I walked in and were overwhelmed by the smell of urine and feces.  My daughter had to back out to the car it was so bad. At that point my husband searched out every boarding place possible. We were stuck.

The owner kept telling me over and over that dogs usually do not eat all of their food when they are kenneled. I disagreed. I have a 9 year old golden who has been kenneled probably twice a year every year and has never not eaten his food. Never.

I found it very troubling that he would go out of his way to say this over and over. Like he was preparing me for that. And wouldn't you know... when we picked him up there was a full day and halfs worth of food that wasn't ""eaten"". I'm thinking he wasn't given it.

When I left him at the kennel, with no other possible option, I drove away crying and scared.

In 9 years, my dog has never tried to get away from a kennel. He loves the other dogs and typically has to be dragged out by us. I could barely hold onto my 100lb dog he was pulling so hard to leave the building.  He smelled so bad that we had to drive with the windows home and run him right into the tub at home.

I will not bring my dog back and I will not recommend that my friends to bring their pups.

My advice... visit the place well a head of kenneling your dog. If I recall correctly, they were updating at the time. Things could be different. Any business owner can take a bad review and improve their facility.

First, you pay for something like a 3 hour block. We got there like 15 minutes before 9 when we were supposed to start at 9, and we didn't have our guns till approximately 9:30. I'm not trying to complain, but if we pay for a period of time to play, I would like the opportunity to play for that entire time.

Second, the guns that they had us use were kind of gross. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a few years.

Third, the course is not too special, but it's okay. It's pretty fun. I wish it could have been cleaned up a bit though. Mow some areas, trim down other areas, just to make it cleaner and a little nicer to play around.

Also, as a side note, when I went there was no snack or drink options there, so bring your own if you want some!

Overall, the staff was quite pleasant, and I had a lot of fun. Mediocre paintball is still quite enjoyable. The things I point out in this review are not because I'm trying to complain, just being transparent so that others know what to expect of this place!",,"{'time': 1527870743169, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Jacob.

Someone recommended that I go visit these guys.

Just before I clicked in to leave my review I saw someone else's comment that mentioned that they are ""fun"" to work with.  That word is an understatement to the word ""smile.""

Not only did they work with us, they took our old tires in trade.

I expected the tires to go the season.

And they did.

Quite well I might add.

Then they went the next season too.

We are now heading into the second season with these tires and they are still going strong thanks to Dale.  Dale and his amazing team of fun informative people to work with.

So, if your looking for dull, boring and rude you will need to go somewhere else.  Here at Dale's you will only receive a top of the line first-class treatment.

The one negative experience I had (which was not with my regular doctor) was that they didn't tell me that I could do physical therapy to help with my jaw pain. They told me it was just something I would have to live with or take pain medication for, in addition to not eating the stuff that was hurting me, which included plain toast. I had to find out from my physical therapist when I was visiting for other things that she could help me with my pain and stiffness. This is pretty minor compared to some of the horrid experiences I've had at other dentists.
They are also great with my kids, whether they are the ones getting the cleaning or just with me during one of my visits.

I left a one dollar tip with the lady working behind the bar. And i offered a suggestion that maybe they shouldn't talk about tips in front of the other customers. Where the gentleman who was doing most of the complaining and wasnt even on shift said ""we have the right to refuse service  to anyone"" and i should go. I commented back i was already leaving because of their behavior. I just got done with my chemo treatment. I had a pink band on my wrist and was never offered a drink or any warm regards. If they dont want my business, fine i get it. i dont spend that much but i walked down to VIP and won 35 dollars tipped 7 dollars out and was much happier. Maybe your employees need to remember if the customer doesnt come in then they dont need to have a job. If they dont like their tips then maybe they need to do a good enough job to be tipped. Because quite frankly I wont ever come back. So you know I have spent more time in the service industry giving my heart and dedication to the public for free and to hear people talk the way these two did I would never give them a dollar nor ever have them near the public ever.

After the initial contact with Sam there was a long null. I finally got a text saying my windows were in production and will be installed the middle of May, Received  another saying  end of May. May 28 I contacted Sam, and he got on it.  They finally called and we set the installation date for June 10th. The installer was awesome, on time no issues. We had a ripped screen he said he will put in a work order and they will contact me in a couple days. It’s been 3 weeks. Talked to the receptionist Autum who leaves you feeling like you are bothering her at work when you talk. She bugged me about  signing the paperwork for financing, I asked about my screen she said I will put a rush request. I signed the paperwork and asked for her to let me know if she received it because I made an error on the first try she never responded. I’m guessing she got it. Again she can’t be bothered. It’s now June 29th still no screen and no contact. The windows are amazing and I love them, but the whole process was just a No!

Right after Justin contacted me and had my screen out in the next day. He was very nice and promt. They have corrected their error and did quick and were pleasant.

Two windows were damaged during installation and another has a significant leak that I got to learn about during a storm. After realizing the leaking window had no caulk applied, I noticed the caulk applied to the other windows was the wrong color and another window had two pieces of casing overlapping rather than one continuous piece.

One of the windows was measured incorrectly so the installers modified my house in order to make the window fit.

Two months later and the problem still hasn't been fixed... and none of my messages/emails have been returned.

On my most recent call, I waited on hold for ten minutes before I got someone who I could barely understand (and who could barely understand me) because she wouldn't turn off her fan, which was apparently blowing across a speaker phone. She put me on hold for an additional 40 minutes before forwarding me to some random extension to leave yet another message that will likely never be returned.

So... damaged windows (still not fixed), shoddy work, and non-responsive/unprofessional customer service.

Most were so good. Checking this place out everything looked so nice, it was so promising so we decided we'd moved in.

A couple of days after moving in, the power began to flicker, completely frying a majority of our electronics, The refrigerator spewed water all over and ruined a majority of our food, the water heater was a joke and apparently wasn't operating, the dryer didn't dry and is backed up with lint, the bathtub leaks like all sorts of crazy, the property is listed as a non smoking property, yet the neighbors leave cigarette butts all over and some, hang out on our private patio and smoke, leaving trash and butts all over. We've been offered nothing as far as compensation and they refuse to let us move to a different unit.

After a month of the hell they put us through, the upstairs unit was rented to a family with a small child and 3 dogs. It was only then that we discovered the floors are paper thin. Between neighbors, there's a solid enough wall that you don't hear them unless they're slamming the cabinets. Since they moved in, they have be a noise nuisance. Their dogs barking, child running up and down the stairs, around the house, pounding on the walls, and running the vacuum at odd hours of the day. We have made multiple noise complaints and it only makes the neighbors worse. We've gone from having issues every other day to the neighbors throwing 3am parties and claiming they have no idea what we're talking about.

The new office girl is horrible. She harassed us for weeks via phone calls, for a noise complaint made and solved a while back and was hung up on the witch hunt about a noise complaint that had already been taken care of. Just nonstop harassment!

So far I'm not impressed with maintenance. They send one guy out who does a ""job"" then days later, they're  back out again with another guy and this new guy says the last guy screwed up.

We're sick and tired of the excuses, and Llyod is telling us we owe them if we want to move out of this nightmare they had the audacity to call 'move in ready'.

Horrible horrible place.

If somehow you're still considering moving here, be aware that they don't allow Christmas Trees of all things. They will nickel and dime you over the dumbest of things and enforce fines for Xmas trees, but not smoking.",,,0x878ecbfbd106e23f:0x4f0755e3b2a5dfdc,False,West Briar Commons,['Apartment complex'],4.0,28,43.51746,-96.8280655,Open ⋅ Closes 5:30PM,444,False,0.25,False,0.3,False,0.25

Cute ""birthday baskets"" and they WRAP GIFTS, complimentary in cute, cute paper and bows! Awesome book store in back. Play area for kids. Cons: I have noticed that I find odd is that it seems like sometimes staff can be short with the kids or follow you like you are going to steal which can make a paying customer uncomfortable. Also long lines and you can wait for 20 minutes in register line. So, avoid ""busy days"" and times.

The last 14 years, they've been my go to - dual residency, going from single to married, navigating teen drivers, and then to empty nest. Everything is super easy to get done with them. I never switched to going through my employer to be ""my company"" Prins always found better for me. The inside scoop here is to check at renewal times. Prins is quick to get back to you. They will treat you fairly, and transitions are easy. The final trick is to not hide or attempt to ""get away"" with hiding drivers, be honest about your situation, and check before you leap into a new place, car, licensed driver. If you fib, you will be caught. If you wanna DIY it yourself, be 100% prepared to run all the scenarios. Prins! Thanks for your help in this next step in our lives!

As an Entertainer it's an easy load in through a service door and there are plenty of outlets with good clean power.  I would highly recommend this event center if you are planning an upcoming event.  Formerly known as the Fireside Event Center... And prior to that this was the Hartford bowling center.  if you have not been in this facility since it was turned into an event center you will be shocked when you walk in the door and see all of the awesome improvements.,"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiHvx94XfgYq9uzj8M9Y1e499nqAOz5xx83k0Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6tYs-Fr0dgRTBU0e9YpaeraXRRXQO0-s0N0SS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA11ieBfq0MuzhCufg6SKWepolZMzO1640v6rA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONHuVuotowaEzchjvKv9QOqpwF2dwAz0CjE8iQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1YjuwA63ITevrcTavM0eW521YRtFVl8JlIjGR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGuLIWD4ecEHfzzOiFfphSPrBydOgfYK3ZL5IK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqHpgBpEyA0LkEZtVGxRde82qsIFo9CPoFuHaq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPut15o5xvYapH7JXGPs7ulw7XJvGKiBVvKl45d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnm-l9WScgITAiQw5Jgf3xGU-kfXRNdT3vHdw5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTQt8-oy0sGvn0Q4vc7nQfM5-01OxdmsggSv9T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-SXyiwcavI-9B-ZKMasf0F7vhVpv_SHUkE-N5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAvb9XEMLpKhdZ_eQjO-PlQeIFsvnFwLe0n2cG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNErzZSSxr61j8xBBG2yg59W3vxr-2S6NKB3f85=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ6iapRoL4unCux3DWi7BfZ1eZYLFO3TCvz82C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPABBbHc4XOKDmP1SMMAGywavvGWDybdiIRs_wx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ-QWQBLCwJ8Or3HPrUTyTTKt1aa-ieMPxhfd9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmGVQvwyvnexdF6Nr0yujXMdkZA4HKw57lKZA_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x87892d0ef4ec92a5:0x9119db991b037294,True,Dakota Plains Event Center,"['Event venue', 'Live music venue', 'Wedding venue']",4.3,18,43.611128199999996,-96.9492054,Permanently closed,136,False,0.25,False,0.25,False,0.25

I tend to think of it as a traditional Men's store, but they have women's clothing and shoes as well, but I think the bulk is dedicated to Men perhaps. A wide variety of high quality clothing from casual jeans, The North Face, Kuhl, and so forth to suits and ties and tayloring services. A decent selection of shoes but limited to a few brands, notably Keen. Staff is always friendly and very open to letting you try on whatever you would like. Prices are usually retail, but they have several sales every year, and if you shop the end of the season you can get some excellent deals. Personally I only go for sale items unless it is something specific I really want. It's great to have them a part of our community. Old school care and service and if I pay a little more (talking maybe 10% at most if shopping right) it is totally worth it to support them and have real service.

We were charged 2.5 work hours when the work itself was done in 30 minutes and it took the person about 1 hour to drive back to their warehouse to get a fitting he did not have in his truck. Even if he would have charged all the time he was gone it does not add up to the 2.5 hours charged. We have never been charged working hours by any business for the time they were taking to get a needed part and are very upset to have to pay $ 325 for the replacement of a pipe fitting! After posting this review we got a call from Mark who immediately offered to fix the problem and send us a check for the over charged hours, it arrived the next day!

The visitor center is occasionally open, however, the main reason to visit is to take a stroll along the paths that outline the arboretum. Dotted along the way are benches, plaques and signage of donors to the site. In spring and summer, locals will start planting various flowers around the area, which is truly a gorgeous site.

The stage isn't really used anymore aside from the roosting pigeons and swallows, which is a bummer because it would be a great place for local talent to perform.

Overall, it's a great place to take a stroll or jog, let kids run around, or even take your dog(s) for a walk. The only downside is that the paths aren't maintained as well as they could be, so ruts and grooves after even a light rain can cause uneven walking surfaces, as well as one of the bridges is becoming detached from its anchors.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2_8MZA2v0gYuWt1rKFSnNqP7l5xEOMcwpil-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0LzIRSed07bP8k8zWpxlncET41f7Ndpg-XUww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMwWz9OkfWqJrBYimR4TR6-al8SZaF1CIyLQvW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh2RY5QkDysYSktRiC8lSm606WC2Z09V1aVdnb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9Dq6P-x3N4yd-qWrUc6raGJiakFPHHAWU7ChI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSoHEUJjDXwebbC_o93f0MMDFN-54AGbyp3A1c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZwzrtL5u5Dz-H8WeHcAK-GFE4zW05n2yDoXAg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaOeI-6QBnTxr2P9aTiX4rkP_Q1zmnA4N55olh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUs8gMk44p7Y-Ax1IgAe1KXn43YQxyNT18Pqw0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5ymxxiaSITgZost6lrVF_f3Sdl9BOk_K6x5Mh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi53KnbLjdYpUe6uaFu2rxl6RfM5AXey3bmoNJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMozvSjaQ0uJIjQfPw-cuBislTEfO57Wk9hoy2W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4r8SWYii-0fIgvVIoKGxzq5zw_2nXXCoPSpkM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeWHZT4ReyMxVp4SKav6xKEc3_EjdekTRsozUi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYEI_oyD_M3NrF27xbUApFt5WQoVU1B83CAdQU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXUEQLTgi-20qC_iRX_xkkGTZG2eFR-IMyFjkW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEpDN9oWJ4oj8rS16dRCZ3pHuzJdZanHyr2ic1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x878f389d834c23c9:0xacdc3e753564ef04,True,Freeman Prairie Arboretum,['Park'],4.7,34,43.3451762,-97.4374789,,178,False,0.05,False,0.15,False,0.15

So far the best experience we have had with a dealership. We filled out an online application and they called us the next day with what we needed for downpayment, we went in that night to value our 2 trade ins and traded in both vehicles the next day that covered our downpayment, gave us a more than fair trade in value for both. They showed us 2 different vehicles an 18 journey and an 09 journey. Only reason we chose the 09 is it had a shorter loan term that worked best for us at this time. They were not pushy like most salesman who wouldve insisted we took the 18 but they understood what we wanted.

They took two weeks because someone was sick which I understand, but they wouldn't call to give updates and then one of the times we called to check on how far along they were said they forgot to get to it that day. We finally got it back and they did changed the spark plugs for free and did an oil change to make up for it. I felt a little better but then we had to go back for the same exact problem recently. They said it should only take half an hour to fix, mind you we had made an appointment so they knew we were coming. So we left, I was on my lunch break, and told them we'd be back after I was out of work. We get back about three hours later and when he saw us he just laughs and says ""oh didn't do it should take like 15 minutes"" so we left to go drop off groceries at our house and came back 30 minutes later and HE STILL HAD NOT DONE IT. Finally we get there he does it and we are on our way back home. All the way home I'm driving behind the car and the smoke is way worse than when we brought it in and when I get home it's leaking oil worse than when he had ""fixed it"" called him to let him know and told him he made it worse and to call me back and they never did. My fiance put a review and they commented on it and had the audacity to tell us it was not smoke but it was vapor because they had washed the engine.

Have had several other issues concerning policy that I do not agree with. For example online banking down for 3 days over Labor Day. Restrictions on the numbers of transfers.

All in all, it's a clean store with a decent stock. I do caution that you check dates on everything as at their other location I've bought expired dry goods so I have learned my lesson.

The contractor/landlord told us we can get the keys to the box f et on the post office. So I went to the post office while I was waiting I line I heard the clerk being condescending and rude to the person she was helping. Then my turn I told her what I needed she looked at the address and said oh we don't have the keys to that street yet I said well he told us to come here and she replied well I don't know what to tell you we don't have the keys you need to fill out a yellow card. All that was said in the same rude condescending tone she had with the woman before me. She was acting like I was waisting her time. So I go fill out a yellow card hand it back another clerk and leave. I called the contractor who says the keys to all the boxes were turned in two weeks ago. So I go back in to find the one I turned the card into mocking me to what must have been the manager. As I made my present know both clerks walked away. I told her what my contractor said she and she said she had the keys but has been waiting on the master lock and it was still not in. Once it came it needed to be installed.. So not only did the clerk give bad information she was rude and horrible, and yet somehow her manager felt her behavior was ok and did not feel the need to say sorry.

The post master said she'd return my call and never did and then the post carrier came to my door  (for the first time ever) just to tell me how he didn't appreciate how I complained about him, got him in trouble and tried to guilt me for him not doing his job. He finally apologized for not delivering my mail and carrying it in his car for a week, making it so I couldn't pick it up at the post office.

David put me at ease as I didn't want to jump threw a bunch of hoops. He did say it could be a while to get this done possible 12 to 18 months before we got to the finish line because we were dealing with the Social Security Department.
I got him all my records and after the 2 meeting really didn't have high hopes of getting approval for Social Security Disability.
4 months into it I was checking my bank account on my phone and there's this huge deposit in my checking account from The Treasury department Social Security.
I can't say enough about every one at David King's Law Firm.
I still a month after the fact am in shock as to how fast it was approved for myself.
I know not everyone has the same thing going on with their claims but David King is your best bet hands down.

First month was over $400, and the months thereafter will be more expensive than what they were on originally. They also gave them an unnecessary tablet (which they are paying for) to serve as a replacement for their WiFi. On their plan (which is shared between 2 phones and now their home wifi), they only have enough data per month to watch approximately 1 hour of HD video before they will be charged an overage fee and run out of data for the month. The sales rep knowingly took advantage of the fact that my grandparents don't know how the technology works and now they are locked in to a 2 year contract and can't do anything about it. WARN everyone to tell their elderly family members to not do business with Verizon or to help them with this process before they are stuck paying a ridiculous amount of money every month for the next 2 years.

16990,1.1489478640269969e+20,Tammy Hunsaker,1610372234334,5,"I started with Orchard Meadows 2 years ago — about 10 years later than I wish I would have.

I needed some pretty extensive and expensive work.  I was scared and embarrassed I had let my teeth get to this point.  I knew it was going to be expensive, I was afraid it was going to be painful, and I had gotten enough lectures about how much of my parents money I had wasted on not keeping up on the outstanding dental care they had once paid for. I had been to several dentists in town and wasted several thousand dollars on plans that took none of what I really wanted and needed long term into account.  I was spending thousands of dollars a year and was not getting anywhere near what I needed and wanted.
I had broken a tooth and my sister-in-law was literally in the hospital dying.  My regular dentist couldn’t get me in and someone suggested I call “Dr. Mark” -  I called from the ICU waiting room,   They got me in to get me in —and out of pain THAT day.  From the moment I walked into his office, I was home.
I scheduled a consult where Dr. Gardner took time to walk through what my options were.  He looked at ALL of my concerns and even listened to my wife’s concerns — who tends to worry more than even me) not only the cost, but my fears of the process and the longevity, the timing, etc.). He helped us create the very best plan for me.  When I attempted to pick something that was not what he though was best, he carefully explained why it was not the best option and worked with me to make the suggested option affordable- so I could really pick the BEST option, he didn’t just tell me tough luck.

The office staff is professional and friendly.  They are very qualified and fun and you can tell that it is a great working environment. In the last 2 years we have had an opportunity to get to talk with and know some of the staff outside of the office and I believe them when they say they would never work anyplace else.
In today’s world, we have less and less options about where we spend our medical dollars.  So much is based on who takes what insurance and what deductible is met where.  For better or worse, Dentistry is one place where I get to control my spending almost 100%. I want to spend that money where I will get the best value and get the most impact for my money.  Orchard Meadows is that place.  They are good people doing good work for a reasonable rate. (Well, reasonable in dentist 💸)   I am very thankful to have found Orchard Meadows.",,,0x877d5d2f8088d83d:0xf2dbfae1484b2b83,False,Orchard Meadows Family Dental & Denture Clinic,"['Dentist', 'Cosmetic dentist', 'Pediatric dentist']",4.9,258,44.059913599999994,-103.15740199999999,Opens soon ⋅ 8AM,472,False,0.25,False,0.25,False,0.3

When all was said and done it still ended up costing me almost $300 more than I was originally told. Other than that they have been more than willing to assist me with the fitting and adjustment of them although it's still a work in progress. The only other thing I wasn't to pleased with was the amount of bone spurs that followed after having the rest of my teeth removed in preparation for my dentures.

They would tell us we don't need an appointment to pick up bridemaids dresses and it was prom season so when we went in to grab them they wouldn't help us or even acknowledge us. They were terrible about getting me any information I needed about time frame or what we picked out for what guys. I asked the week before the wedding and the week of and I was told tuxes would be in the Wednesday before the wedding. Made me nervous being so close but they assured me if nothing fit exactly right that they would have overnight shipping. Wednesday came and they never called and so when I called at 6 they said it was coming Thursday. It was frustrating not even being let know this was happening and it would be late. They come Thursday late afternoon. They went over what we had orders when they guys picked them up. One of our usher didn't know because they lady helping him told him he had the right things when he groomsmen attire and not his usher attire. He didn't know so he didn't let me know and I didn't realize the day of the wedding. I loved my dress, the bridemaids and the quality and price of the tuxes and the dresses.

18054,1.1545018170281529e+20,bsfergen,1477844549160,1,"Verizon should stand behind the phones it sells.  Just because a phone company comes out with the ""newest and latest"" phone, doesn't mean that it should be sold immediately, despite the media hype.  The Samsung Note 7 is one example.  Talk about causing the customer huge hassles.  I'm tired of the hearing that everything is the manufacture's problem.

The Google Pixel is another example of a phone that Verizon should not be selling, especially without a stock of cases and screen protectors.

The Pixel is made for people who live in a glass bubble.  It is so delicate and easy to break it is unbelievable.  People in the real world drop their phones frequently.  Glass on the back of a phone is ridiculous.  When a customer pays over $600 for a phone, it should be made to withstand everyday wear and tear!  Moreover, Verizon should know that the phone is ""delicate"" and they should have cases and screen protectors before they sell this phone.

It's also a serious problem when the people buying the phones are more knowledgeable about the features than the salesperson in the store.  There is no excuse for selling a phone before making sure that all the sales people are trained and have a good knowledge of the phone specs.  A good salesperson should be looking out for their customers.  They should tell the customers about the pros and cons of different phones.  They should steer young people and people in certain occupations away from phones that are less likely to hold up for people with ""active"" lifestyles.  Having bought phones from the Vermillion Wireless World store for approximately 10 years, I can say that the current sales people could care less about the customer's needs.  They are happy to steer customers to the ""newest"" and most ""expensive"" phones without talking to the customer about what would work best for their age/lifestyle.

PLEASE overlook the minor inconveniences that come with a facilities remodel. The heart of I-90 Speedway is solidly grounded and it is great to see dirt track racing is back. The show on this night got started late because of weather conditions on the days leading up to the show.

The show ran long because they had 118 cars in five classes. That is a great problem to have. If you are a casual race fan, a newbie to the sport, or a diehard who has been attending races for 50 years, the one thing to take away from this visit was the fact that you were entertained with some great dirt track racing.

It is clear that a lot of work has been done at I-90. It is clear that a lot of work remains to be done... especially in the seating areas. But, at the end of the night, the thing that matters is the on track action.... and there was plenty of it. A huge thank you needs to be extended to Lyle Howey, Rod Pattison and the entire staff for bringing I-90 Speedway back to life.  Despite the inconveniences, we as fans, got what we paid to see... some great racing.

Grab your bag chair, bring your significant other, your kids, your neighbors, your friends. Get a little dirt in your hair, reconnect with some old friends, make some new friends, and have a great time.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM04l3j3UAH4VLbYJgUbY7lK4RPtRoxw3ey-5F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTv25s7jF9EFl_RMuQoYJ4MEWq1qTxbW-jbftt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlOKksiuIwGRGif8Gubms4yLBhqX4132zXu15G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz-jWKWQMjtjDLduJ-XBOoKbNwL-ereVBk-a_g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-HjD39P_zMc0aVk9aBu-rCb61_mDJ7fQlS_kn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh3yoK1Mdxp-yqqYaFqy6WENMTBI2YYOM3O666=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x87892c73182714c9:0x8549cb05c87f5573,True,I-90 Speedway,['Car racing track'],4.6,148,43.635050199999995,-96.9977546,,263,False,0.92,False,0.92,False,0.92

While that may throw off some, I hope this review would convince those otherwise.  Jack used to work for a local dealer fixing and repairing dents, his father is also in the auto repair industry.

Jack is very friendly and you can gather that just by giving him a call, go ahead, try it.  You will need to call ahead to make an appointment.  When you are able to get your vehicle in, usually a 1-2 week lead time (or sooner, if needed, as he will offer to work late into the night for you), Jack will look over your areas of concern (or more if you are willing).  His lighting setup will find dents and scratches that you didn't even know were there.  He does pre-warn you, though, if you want to learn where those other dents are.  I took him up on the offer and we found four additional dents, mostly from door bangers.

Jack is very detail oriented, on the verge of OCD, and he loves his job.  He loves fixing the dents and making things right again.  Now, while not all dents will return to 100% factory spec, they will at least be as near perfect as can be done using all of the specialized tools of the trade.

Jack will go over all of the dents with you and, at least for me, included many of those extra dents for free (or a lower cost) as part of the overall cost.  Remember that detail orientation and loves fixing dents part earlier?  I think the dents are imperfections that are just calling Jack to fix them.

Out of all of my dents (7 or so in total), only the very complicated one was not perfect.  Under his sophisticated lighting setup you could see a slight hint of waviness in that general location.  Without those lights on it, it looked perfect.  Frankly, no one would ever know, my wife didn't notice it at all and thinks it looks perfect, just like new.

Jack is a great guy and he is just starting a great thing, please send him your business, you will be glad you did and he is very deserving of it.",,"{'time': 1511366828198, 'text': ""Thank you so much Kory for writing such a phenomenal review for us.

I contacted them when I came and the sign said someone would not be there for the next 3 hours and expressed my outrage.  They invited me to come in and meet with a manager to ""make things right.""  I tried that location TWICE for said meeting, and guess what?  There were never any staff there!  Mind you, this is in the middle of their POSTED ""staffed"" hours.

So I decided to try the Marion location, and wouldn't you know... there was no staff there.  I am convinced that the staff at both locations are imaginary.  If you have a contract you can't get out of, you could probably sell it on the black market to people who are trying to get a membership but can't because no staff will sign them up!
